# Image Processing and Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains five projects exploring fundamental concepts in image processing and computer vision. Each project focuses on a specific topic, with Jupyter Notebook files for code implementation and PDF reports summarizing the project goals, methods, and results.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured into five folders, each representing a distinct project:

- **grayscale:** Converts color images to grayscale and explores different grayscale conversion techniques.
- **gradient:** Calculates and visualizes image gradients for edge detection and feature extraction.
- **filter:** Applies various filters to images, including blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and noise reduction.
- **stitch:** Implements image stitching algorithms to combine multiple images into a panorama.
- **transformation:** Performs various geometric transformations on images, such as rotation, scaling, and translation.

## Installation and Running

1. **Install Python and Required Packages:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. The specific packages needed for each project are listed in the corresponding Jupyter Notebook files. 

2. **Open Jupyter Notebooks:** Navigate to the respective project folder and open the Jupyter Notebook file (e.g., `filter/Filter.ipynb`) to run the code and explore the project.

## Project Descriptions

**1. Grayscale:**

This project focuses on converting color images to grayscale:

- Implementing different grayscale conversion methods (average, luminosity, weighted average).
- Comparing the results of different methods.
- Applying grayscale conversion to enhance image features.

**2. Filter:**

This project demonstrates the application of various image filters to enhance or modify images. It covers:

- Blurring (Gaussian Blur, Mean Blur)
- Sharpening (Sobel Operator, Laplacian Operator)
- Edge Detection (Canny Edge Detection)
- Noise Reduction (Median Filter)

**3. Gradient:**

This project explores image gradients and their applications:

- Calculating gradients using the Sobel operator.
- Visualizing gradients to identify edges and features.
- Applying gradient information for image segmentation.


**4. Stitch:**

This project implements image stitching techniques:

- Feature detection using SIFT or SURF algorithms.
- Feature matching to identify corresponding points in different images.
- Image transformation and blending to create a seamless panorama.

**5. Transformation:**

This project covers geometric transformations in image processing:

- Rotation, scaling, and translation of images.
- Implementing transformations using OpenCV functions.
- Applying transformations to modify image perspectives or align images.
